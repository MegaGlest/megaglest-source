Additionally the special setup of certain widgets, for example in initItemListbox(), initListbox(), initMenubar() and initMultiColumnList(), can be useful interesting to look at in the code"

For the special characters, UTF-8 character encoding is supported by CEGUI and is used in the demo. All &quot;.font&quot; files found in the datafiles' font folder are loaded into the demo. Additionally, some of the supported font file endings (.ttf, .pcf, .otf) are added to the list in the font editor window using the CEGUI ResourceProvider. CEGUI Fonts have size and autoscale settings that can be adjusted in the demo. In CEGUI fonts can be loaded using the &quot;.font&quot; files or can be created in run-time using the CEGUI::FontManager. They can be edited at any time.

When characters are requested to be displayed for the first time, CEGUI might need a short time to create them. This load-time only occurs once and is only significant for big character sets, such as for Asian languages with a broad set of characters."

For the pop-up points a window with animations directly defined in the look n' feel file was made. The animations are triggered by firing events and when the pop-up animation is over the event handler will react to this and subsequently the window will be deleted as defined in the C++ code."
