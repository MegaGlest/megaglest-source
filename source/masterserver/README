To install:

1. Setup a MYSQL database server

2. CREATE DATABASE 'megaglest-master' ENGINE=InnoDB;
   CREATE USER 'megaglest-master'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret password';
   GRANT ALL ON 'megaglest-master.*' TO 'megaglest-master';

3. Connect the new user to the new database;
   Execute the SQL statments in install/scheme_mysql.sql

4. Copy all files (you can omit INSTALL and install/) to your webserver and
   edit config.php to reflect the MySQL connection parameters and game title;
   also replace the images in images/ by some which match your game title.

To test and use this server with your MegaGlest engine based game, configure
the "MasterserverURL" property in glest.ini.

To add mods to the game mod menu, edit the database contents using your 
favorite MySQL editor or develop a web based frontend to do so. In the latter
case, please let us know about it and try to use a compatible license.
