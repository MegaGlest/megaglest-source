/*! \brief allows to strip origins automatically.
 *
 * For every IRC server event, the event origin is sent in standard form:
 * nick!host\@ircserver, i.e. like tim!home\@irc.krasnogorsk.ru. Such origins
 * can not be used in IRC commands, and need to be stripped (i.e. host and 
 * server part should be cut off) before using. This can be done either 
 * explicitly, by calling irc_target_get_nick(), or implicitly for all the 
 * events - by setting this option with irc_option_set().
