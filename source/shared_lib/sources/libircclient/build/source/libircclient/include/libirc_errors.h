/*! \brief Invalid argument
 * 
 * An invalid value was given for one of the arguments to a function. 
 * For example, supplying the NULL value for \a channel argument of 
 * irc_cmd_join() produces LIBIRC_ERR_INVAL error. You should fix the code.

 * The new socket could not be created or made non-blocking. Usually means

/*! \brief Could not connect.
 * 
 * The socket could not connect to the IRC server, or to the destination DCC
 * part. Usually means that either the IRC server is down or its address is 
 * invalid. For DCC the reason usually is the firewall on your or destination
 * computer, which refuses DCC transfer.

 * 
 * The IRC connection was closed by the IRC server (which could mean that an 
 * IRC operator just have banned you from the server :)), or the DCC connection
 * was closed by remote peer - for example, the other side just quits his mIrc.
 * Usually it is not an error.

/*! \brief Out of memory
 * 
 * There are two possible reasons for this error. First is that memory could 
 * not be allocated for libircclient use, and this error usually is fatal.
 * Second reason is that the command queue (which keeps command ready to be 
 * sent to the IRC server) is full, and could not accept more commands yet.
 * In this case you should just wait, and repeat the command later.

 * \ingroup errorcodes

 * \sa LIBIRC_ERR_OPENFILE
 * \ingroup errorcodes

/*! \brief Could not read DCC file or socket
 * 
 * Either a DCC file could not be read (for example, was truncated during 
 * sending), or a DCC socket returns a read error, which usually means that
 * the network connection is terminated.
 *
 * \ingroup errorcodes

/*! \brief Could not write DCC file or socket
 * 
 * Either a DCC file could not be written (for example, there is no free space
 * on disk), or a DCC socket returns a write error, which usually means that
 * the network connection is terminated.
 *
 * \ingroup errorcodes

 * ::event_connect is called.

/*! \brief Operation timed out
 * 
 * The DCC request is timed out. 
 * There is a timer for each DCC request, which tracks connecting, accepting
 * and non-accepted/declined DCC requests. For every request this timer
 * is currently 60 seconds. If the DCC request was not connected, accepted
 * or declined during this time, it will be terminated with this error.
