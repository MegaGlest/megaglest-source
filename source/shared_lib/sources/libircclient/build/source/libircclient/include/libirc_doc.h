/*! \mainpage libircclient - a IRC library to create IRC clients
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * libircclient is a small but powerful library, which implements client-server IRC
 * protocol. It is designed to be small, fast, portable and compatible to RFC
 * standards, and most IRC clients. libircclient features include:
 * - Full multi-threading support.
 * - Single threads handles all the IRC processing.
 * - Support for single-threaded applications, and socket-based applications, 
 *   which use select()
 * - Synchronous and asynchronous interfaces.
 * - CTCP support with optional build-in reply code.
 * - Flexible DCC support, including both DCC chat, and DCC file transfer.
 * - Can both initiate and react to initiated DCC.
 * - Can accept or decline DCC sessions asynchronously.
 * - Plain C interface and implementation (possible to use from C++ code, 
 *   obviously)
 * - Compatible with RFC 1459 and most IRC clients.
 * - Free, licensed under LGPL license.
 * - Good documentation and examples available.
 *
