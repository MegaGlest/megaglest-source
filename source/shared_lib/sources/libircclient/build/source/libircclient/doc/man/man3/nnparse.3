Gets the host part from the target.

\fBParameters:\fP

\fItarget\fP A nick in common IRC server form like tim!root@mydomain.com

\fInick\fP A buffer to hold the nickname.

\fIsize\fP A buffer size. If nick is longer than buffer size, it will be truncated.

For most events IRC server returns 'origin' (i.e. the person, who generated this event) in i.e. 'common' form, like nick!host@domain. I don't know any command, which requires host, but it may be useful :) This function parses this origin, and gets the host, storing it into user-provided buffer.

For most events IRC server returns 'origin' (i.e. the person, who generated this event) in i.e. 'common' form, like nick!host@domain. However, all the irc_cmd_* functions require just a nick/ This function parses this origin, and gets the nick, storing it into user-provided buffer. A buffer of size 90 should be enough for most nicks :)
