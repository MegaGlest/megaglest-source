IRCClient.framework 1.0 by Nathan Ollerenshaw (chrome@stupendous.net)

This is a Cocoa framework wrapper around Georgy Yunaev's (gyunaev@ulduzsoft.com)
excellent libircclient library.

While Georgy's library is portable, obviously this Cocoa framework is specific
to Mac OS X systems. Though you might be able to get it working under
cocotron or GNUstep, those implementations of Cocoa are not supported.

To build the framework, you will need to configure libircclient library first. 
From the Terminal, run the following command in the distribution directory:

 ./configure --enable-thread --enable-ipv6

The Xcode project is configured to include the libircclient.c source.

The framework is configured to build with a relative path of ../Frameworks/ so
it can be easily embedded in your application.

For documentation, examine the header files or read the Doxygen documentations
in 'doc'.
