This is the source code to liblzma from XZ Utils:

    http://tukaani.org/xz/

This is a snapshot of the xz-5.0.0 release. Changes I've made to it are
 wrapped in #if __MOJOSETUP__ blocks. I've tried to agressively delete files
 we don't use at all, too.

The source code in this directory is public domain.
