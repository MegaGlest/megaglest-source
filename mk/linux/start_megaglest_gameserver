# Start a headless MegaGlest game server (and keep it running)
#
# Using this script, a headless game server is started, waiting for players to 
# connect (if your firewall configuration permits). Players connect and start a
# game. As soon as the game ends, the server will quit, and this script will 
# start up a new server immidiately. This is a stability measure to  rule out 
# the unlikely case where side effects (such as memory leaks or corruption) 
# could drain on system resources.
#
# For this to work, Internet originated traffic must be able to reach the 
# server on the following ports:
# TCP port 61357: game protocol port
# TCP port 61358: FTP control port
# TCP ports 61359 to 61366: FTP data ports
#
# Once publishing to the master server succeeded (this can be verified at
# <http://master.megaglest.org>) you may connect to your headless game server
# using a copy of MegaGlest you have installed on a Desktop computer. The first
# user connecting to a headless server controls it. If this user disconnects, 
# the next user who connects (or had already connected) takes control.
