MegaGlest is an entertaining free (freeware and free software)
and open source cross-platform 3D real-time strategy (RTS) game,
where you control the armies of one of seven different factions:
Tech, Magic, Egypt, Indians, Norsemen, Persian or Romans. The
game is played in one of 17 naturally looking settings, which,
like the unit models, are crafted with great attention to
detail. A lot of additional game data can be downloaded from
