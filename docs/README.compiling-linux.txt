~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                         Build instructions for Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 1. Architecture ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developed on Linux with glibc, little endian CPU. While MacIntel builds exist
(for some versions of the game), MegaGlest does not currently work on big
endian CPUs like PPC (though some unfinished patches for vanilla Glest float
around on the forums, e.g. https://forum.megaglest.org/?topic=1426#).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 2. Building and Installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--- 2.1 Prerequesites ---

Compiling MegaGlest requires the following dependencies to be installed:

* Standard GNU compiler and additional tools (g++ version 4.6.3 or later is
  required at the moment)

* Kitware CMake 2.8.2 or later (used as build tool)

* X11 libraries + headers
  http://x.org/

* SDL 2.0.0 or later
  http://libsdl.org/

* OpenGL
  http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/libGL

* libvlc
  http://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html

* libcurl
  http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

* wxWidgets
  http://wxwidgets.org/

* OpenAL
  http://openal.org/

* Ogg
  http://xiph.org/ogg/

* Vorbis
  http://xiph.org/vorbis/

* Xerces-C
  http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/

* Lua 5.1 or later
  http://www.lua.org/

* JPEG
  http://www.ijg.org/

* PNG
  http://www.libpng.org/

* Zlib
  http://zlib.net/

* GnuTLS

* ICU
  http://site.icu-project.org/

* libdl

NOTE: A script which tries to install build dependencies on many Linux distros
is located in mk/linux/setupBuildDeps.sh

--- 2.2 Building ---

To build the game simply invoke the build script:

../mk/linux/build-mg.sh

This script manually calls cmake with some optional parameters. Feel free to 
examine it and build manually using cmake.

--- 2.3 Installation --

We provide MojoSetup based installers for Linux and NSIS based installers for
Windows. By default, the Linux installers install to your home directory. The
Windows installers install to %ProgramFiles% (global system scope).

There are also community maintained packages available for several Linux and
BSD distributions. Please see the website, forums and wiki for details.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 3. Troubleshooting ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--- General ---
* Make sure both the hardware and software of your system match the requirements
* If you cannot find what you are looking for on here please check the FAQs
  (https://docs.megaglest.org/MG/FAQ) before contacting the developers.

--- Compiling ---
* If CMake reports that it cannot find some of the libraries, make sure that 
  the relevant ...-dev(el) packages are also installed (distro-dependent).

--- Sound/Audio ---
* If the game doesn't start because of audio/sound errors:
  Make sure no other application is using your soundcard. Typical problems are
  the Gnome/KDE sound dameons esd and artsd. You can kill these daemons with
  the following commands:
  	# killall esd ; killall artsd

* If this doesn't solve the sound problems, get an updated OpenAL from
  http://openal.org or a newer repository provided by your distribution.

* Sound is played through OpenAL - double-check the OpenAL system 
  configuration: http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/OpenAL_Configuration

--- OpenGL  ---
* If the game produces error messages regarding OpenGL or OpenGL extensions
  being unavailable, look at glxinfo and make sure the system is using the 
  drivers you want to use. If you have a NVIDIA or AMD/ATI graphics card then 
  consider using the proprietary drivers, which may provide better 
  performance than the open source drivers most distributions use by default.
  Most Intel graphics chips use an open source driver on Linux, based on Mesa
  ("glxinfo | grep -i mesa"). This hardware is much slower than any dedicated
  graphics cards produced during the past few years. The same holds true for
  AMD APUs (the graphics chips embedded into AMD processors).

--- Crashing ---
* Check the forums at https://forums.megaglest.org/
* Please report any crashes and freezes that are not yet described on the forums, 
  preferably with a gdb backtrace from a debugging enabled build 
  (cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo)
