3.3.2
- Changed windows version to use SDL and also added support for OpenAL sound
  (DirectSound is still the default)
- Sound issues for windows users are related to a bad dsound.dll in the 
  mega-glest folder. Delete this file as it is not required since DirectX should
  already be installed on your Windows installation.
- Textures may now be in any of the following formats (tga, bmp, jpg and png)
- Scenarios, Techs and Factions all allow for a custom 'loading' page when 
  starting a game. Mega-Glest will look for a file called: loading_screen.*
  where .* is any supported graphic file type (tga, bmp, jpg and png). The 
  priority is first in the scenario folder (if loading a scenario) if not found
  it looks in the faction root folder and if not found it will look in the tech
  folder.

- Added a LAN game auto-discovery feature. Clients may click the 'Find LAN Games'
  button to search on your local network for another Computer hosting a 
  Mega-Glest game (a server).

  game / mao scenario by setting the value in glest.ini:
  PhotoMode=true

  in a network game. Goto the options area (Options button on main screen) 
  and type your custom playername into the Network Player Name edit box.
- Added the ability to rotate units when creating a unit (before placing it) 
  by pressing the R key (for rotate)
- Added camera zoom in/ out (like in GAE) by using the scroll wheel on your 
  scroll mouse
- Added MANY new configurable items in glest.ini (some are optional and may not
  be in the ini file. Most options are described when you run the configurator
  application.
- Added the ability to run Glest full screen on multiple monitors 
  (currently linux only) via the two settings in glest.ini:
  AutoMaxFullScreen=true
  Windowed=false
- Users may now save all user created context in their own customer folder using
  the glest.ini setting:
  UserData_Root=mydata/
  where mydata is a folder under the current glest folder. You may use ANY path
  in this setting.
- Glest allows users to specify a special folder to read / write the ini and log
  files. To do this set an environment variable with the name:
  GLESTHOME=/mycustomerpathtoawritablefolder/
- When experiencing problems, users may enable debugging to a logfile using the 
  following glest.ini settings:
  DebugLogFile=debug.log
  DebugMode=true
  DebugNetwork=true
  This will log all debug information to a file in the glest folder called 
  debug.log
- fixed a bug with not calling <unitDied> in lua scenario, when died due 
  to running out of consumable ressources like food
- fixed the bug which lets you loose the active command if one of your unit dies. 
  This was the problem that made it very hard to build buildings when you are in 
  a battle for example.
- When a AI is disable for a faction in a scenario this faction doesn't consume
  consumable ressources like food any more. 

3.3.1
- fixed a bug with network consistency checks ( it wasn't completly active any more in 3.3.0 )
- network consistency checks are reported more user friendly (on server and client )
- all network related errors should be handled with a dialog and doesn't crash glest any more.

3.3.0
- New multiplayer version of megaglest! It should be much more stable now 
  and less choppy than original glest !
- New disconnect messages and chat in connect menu .....
